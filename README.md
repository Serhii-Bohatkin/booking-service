## Entitiesüíæ

1. **Booking**: The Booking entity represents a reservation made within the system.
   It includes information such as a unique identifier, check-in and check-out dates, the associated accommodation,
   the user making the booking, booking status, and a soft deletion flag.
2. **Accommodation**: The Accommodation entity holds crucial information about available living spaces.
   It includes details such as accommodation type (e.g., HOUSE, APARTMENT), location, size (e.g., STUDIO, ONE_BEDROOM),
   amenities, daily rental rate, and availability count.
   Soft deletion is implemented, allowing accommodations to be marked as deleted without permanent removal.
   This entity is fundamental to efficiently managing and offering diverse housing options within the system.
3. **User (Customer)**: The user entity represents detailed information about registered users.
   At this stage, there are only 2 roles that grant certain access rights to users, these are: user and admin.
4. **Payment**: The Payment entity encapsulates information about a financial transaction. It includes a unique
   identifier, payment status (e.g., PENDING, PAID),
   associated booking, session URL for payment processing, session ID, payment amount, and a soft deletion flag for
   improved data management.
